**Description:** In New York City, many people live in food-insecure households, and they are unable to afford an adequate supply of food. The objective of this project is to analyze and demonstrate the scale of the food insecurity issue in NYC, visualize areas that have lack of access to food benefits. Show data comparison for the past few years to see the NYC hunger tendency and demonstrate the food insecurity rate using NYC Open Data and Feed America dataset for the past few years.
